### What this talk is:
* Learning how we can better speak the same language
* Insight into the mind of a developer


## Complexity

The iceberg: Seemingly simple tasks are not always simple.

Example Task: *&ldquo;We need a page where users can log on to our site&hellip;&rdquo;*

Actions x Conditions = Scenarios





## Values 

Weigh the cost and value of every feature build.

Software is not a plastic plant; it's a living, breathing garden.

Simple solutions are an aspiration.



## Problems

Programming is problem solving. 

The criteria is not just whether there are bugs, but how they're addressed.

**Reporting issues:**

* Give as many details as possible.
* Don't spend too much time diagnosing, focus on the symptoms.

## Platforms

Where I test:

* Mac: Latest Chrome, FireFox and Safari
* PC: IE9, Chrome, Firefox
* Mobile: iPhone
* What other platforms do you need your site to function well on?

Weigh the cost of backwards compatibility.

Look at [general statistics ala StatCounter](http://gs.statcounter.com/) and also statistics relative to your site ala Google Analytics.
