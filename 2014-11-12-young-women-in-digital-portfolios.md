## Intros




## Outline
+ Planning
+ Execution
+ Examples and inspiration




## In your opinion...
* What makes a portfolio successful?
* What elements should a portfolio have?
* What mistakes do portfolios make?




## Planning

__Identify your goals__

* Obtain a job 
* Obtain clients / freelance
* Networking / online presence / reputation

__Identify your audience__ 

* Think about your target audience and consider different, catered versions of your portfolio.
* Who is receiving this? An HR department? Founder of a small company? How might your approaches differ? 
* Are they proficient in what you're selling? Ex: Applying to a marketing firm vs. applying to do marketing work for a clothing store.




## Strategies

### Function
The focus is on the work; the portfolio itself is subtle and lets the content shine.

### Form
The portfolio itself is the star; the work becomes almost secondary to the presentation of it. Often, very experimental:

### Identity (Virtual Business Card)

* [Rob Young](http://eisforeffort.com)
* [Petra Sell](http://volpelino.com)

### Pitch
Your work alone does not always get you the job. You could have the most fantastic work, but if you can't apply that work to the context in which you're aiming for, you're not going to stand out. Aim to show your target how your skills and experience can work for them.
